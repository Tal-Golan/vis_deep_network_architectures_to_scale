### Plot deep neural network architectures to scale (same units for height, width, features). &nbsp;


![Demo architecture](dnn_architecture.png)
Run `main.m` to plot a demo figure.


Tweak `demo_network.m` to change the layers' dimensions, the locations of the visualized units and their corresponding receptive fields.
