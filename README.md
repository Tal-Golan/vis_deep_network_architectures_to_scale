# Plot deep neural network architectures to scale (same units for height, width, features). &nbsp;
&nbsp;
![Demo architecture](dnn_architecture.png)
&nbsp;
Run main.m to plot a demo figure. &nbsp;
Tweak demo network to change the layer's dimensions, the locations of the visualized units and their corresponding receptive fields. &nbsp;
